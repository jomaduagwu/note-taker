On app load, the user is presenting with a landing page to get started. Once the 'get started' button is clicked, the user is routed to the notes app where a note with a title can be entered and saved. Saved notes will be displayed on the left-hand column, while the right-hand column will be the main section to add notes and view previously added notes. Notes can be deleted from the saved notes section.
